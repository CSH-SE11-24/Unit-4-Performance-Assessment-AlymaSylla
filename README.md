bootstrap-I would say bootstrap made my programming experience more easier becuase it gives the guide(layout) to cretaing the apge then its up to you to make it up to par and put in your own asthetic and style-inspiration
mvp plan-I wasnt really paying to much attention to the mvp plan I was trying to see whta I could make and then after I finished I tried aligning it to the requirments of our projects.I ended up having to use the notepad app to record what I needed to do next.I feel like if you mind the plan to much you are'nt giving in any accordnaace to yourself
features-the features im most proud of are the home page and fetaured page you can see how I implented some of my creativity,for example matching the color of the image with the card and putting in verses of a nasheed that talks baout hijabs(in my opinion the verses show corelation to whoever reads it) Also the featured page was my idea it wanst mentioned on their webpage i feel like my webpage and their webpage is a huge differnece because theirs doesnt give in the professional scenery whereas mine does and it mixes with their sybol the star and y2k vibes.I can see where javascript is included in their webpage.The featured page shows awareness to customers and I belive thats a cool thing to do as it brings more intercations to the brand.
time-if i had more time id make the page more neat because I feel like things are a bit all over the place with differnet tags such as the u,center,etc.A neat page is more easier for me as I navigate through the site.However as long as it works for me thats good,cant beat myself up to much
